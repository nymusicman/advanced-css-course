Selecting Breakpoints: 
    Bad: Using width of existing devices. Usually using Apple products. Problems are not future proof and Apple may not be the most used device.

    Good: Look at all the most used devices on the internet and try to group together to figure out breakpoints.

    Perfect: Ignore devices. Look at contereaknt and design.
        Begin either mobile or desktop and then start increasing/descreasing screen width until something looks broken, then use that as a breakpoint.
